# Prototyping Framework

This is a prototyping framework. This is a code base with a lot of pre-built UI widgets and tools to make protoyping web experiences very fast. 

# Scope of Prototypes


### Protoypes are throwaway. Repeat. Protoypes are throwaway. 

This is NOT a front-end development framework like Twitter Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation. You are not expected to use this code for production. 
The implementation of UI components, etc are under the assumption that this is a throw away code base.
