# Prototyping Framework

This is a prototyping framework. This is a code base with a lot of pre-built UI widgets and tools to make protoyping web experiences very fast. 

# Scope of Prototypes

This toolset is meant to be used to create prototypes only. The intent of the prototype is to enable quick realization of a concept. 

## What does that mean?

Efficiency is not a priority. The generated source is expected to use AMD where the dependencies are not bundled but downloaded at run time. The generated web page may take a few seconds to fully load and that is not a pressing issue. 

Browser support is not a priority. This prototype will work only in that browser which has maximum support for future web technologies, which at the time of this writing is Google chrome.

### Protoypes are throwaway. Repeat. Protoypes are throwaway. 

This is NOT a front-end development framework like Twitter Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation. You are not expected to use this code for production. 

The implementation of UI components, etc are under the assumption that this is a throw away code base.
